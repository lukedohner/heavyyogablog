Laziness is the greatest goal one can aspire too. I have no need for anything outside of the attained. I am free from any effort.
 I AM FULFILLED IN THE PRESENT LOVELY LAZINESS .
I love this indulgence of freedom from work and responsibility, this is the perfect state, doing nothing. Completely lazy, not doing what is required, no projects or goals.
 THIS IS MY JOB LAZY.
The lazier one is the lazier one can feel. Free to do as I wish, to do nothing. I am happy letting the weight of ambition float off. 
I can do anything with hard work. But to be lazy is the sweetest. I like it. I'm leaving myself relaxed for nothing, that is what I want.

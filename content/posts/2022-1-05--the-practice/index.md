### HEAVY YOGA IS THE PRACTICING OF, DOING NOTHING.
Gravity is the weakest force, in Heavy Yoga gravity does all the work. A flat pile of rocks pressing into the earth, being as flat as it can, this is Heavy Yoga. Laziness, falling, and slumping are all virtues in Heavy Yoga. 
Extra effort is always discouraged. 
Heavy Yoga is observance of weight on the world and the body. There are a limited number of Heavy Yoga movements. These poses require no effort. 
Heavy Yoga is not edgy or athletic. 

Heavy yoga is for people who may be tired the best thing to do is nothing. Let gravity do the work for you, that is what gravity is therefore, to take the weight and hold it to earth. 
Gravity is love; loving is just stronger than liking.

### History of Heavy Yoga

Stones lay deeply on the ground along time ago, much heavier than stones today. The earth was heavy and solid. Gravity was at its full strength. When the will to work was felt by objects gravity became weaker. 

###Stones that once lay heavily on the ground now only slanted toward earth. 

Gravity became the weakest force and the most hated of all the forces on the earth. Not until about 6,000 B.C. (early agriculture) did gravity begin to regain it's strength. Early in the 20th Century some people began developing practical uses for gravity; one use was the practice of yoga. This group became known as Heavy Yoga, was reacting against the disipline of yoga. Resting on the principle of non-resistance. 
###And using obedience as a force of non-compliance.
